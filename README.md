# DiaCheck-ML

DiaChek is an application designed to predict the potential for early diabetes in individuals by analyzing initial health data. This app was created to help users understand the risks of diabetes in its early stages, thereby enabling them to take appropriate preventive measures. By utilizing machine learning algorithms using Deep Neural Network (DNN) and health data such as health history, BMI, age, HbA1c level, and other factors, DiaChek provides accurate predictions about the likelihood of developing diabetes in the future.

## About Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the prediction model in DiaChek is sourced from Kaggle, you can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/717451f4573e9c3d8963e626808ade67a89fbd2ee660be008c1aba16b2a2345a). This dataset contains medical information about individuals and includes key features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, glucose levels, and blood glucose level, which are used to predict the risk of diabetes.
